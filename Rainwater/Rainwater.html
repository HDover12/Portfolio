        <strong class="challengeTitle"> The Challenge</strong><br /><br />
        For this challenge, I created a capturingRainwater() function that takes
        in an array of heights, and returns the amount of rainwater that could
        be contained in that array. For example, the array [4, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2]
        would give the folowing histogram:
        <br />
        <br /><img
          src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/curriculum/code-challenges/Image%202.svg"
          alt=""
        /><br />
        <br />
        This means that a total of 6 units of water could be captured in this
        example. <br /><br />
        <strong class="challengeTitle"> My Solution</strong><br /><br />
        My approach to this challenge was to loop through each number in the
        array and slice out the section before that number and the section after
        that number. I then found the maxium number before and after. Water
        would only collect up to the second highest of those two maximum
        numbers. I could then subtract the second highest number from the height
        of the current number and that would give me how much water that spot
        could hold. All that would be left would be to add up each spot.
        <br /><br />
        Feel free to test it out below by entering numbers for the array. The
        function that I wrote is also pictured below.
